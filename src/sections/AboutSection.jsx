                <h2>Who made this website?</h2>
                <p>Hi, there! I am Joana, a <b>UX/UI Designer and Frontend Developer</b> with a background in Computer Science and Engineering.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am passionate about researching and empathizing with users to deeply understand their needs and uncover the best solutions to address their pain points.
                    I thrive in the space where user experience meets technology, aiming to create intuitive, user-centered designs that are both functional and delightful.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    What excites me most is the creative journey â€” from idea to execution.
                    I love bringing designs to life through modern tools and frameworks, translating thoughtful user experiences into seamless, responsive,
                    and visually engaging interfaces.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>);
